A Physics graduate with hands-on experience in data analysis, experimental design, and equipment management. As a former science laboratory technician, I am experienced in preparing and calibrating scientific instruments, analyzing complex data sets, and supporting research projects. Possesses solid foundational skills in statistical analysis, computational methods, and data handling.

I also love frozen yoghurt.

### ðŸ“Œ Projects:
Here are some of my favourite projects:

### 1. [Identification of Fake Product Reviews](https://github.com/rdelmo/Identification-of-Fake-Product-Reviews)
* **Problem:** It is difficult for us humans to distinguish fake reviews from genuine reviews hence the need for assistance using artificial intelligence; this project aims to deploy intelligent systems to accurately identify fake reviews.
* **Approach:** NLP techniques extracted linguistic, behavioural, and sentiment features from reviews. Using 44,000 labelled reviews, traditional supervised machine learning approach was adopted (LR, NB, DT, SVM, RF, AdaBoost, KNN, and Stacking).
* **Impact:** AdaBoost was identified as the optimal model; when hyperparameter-tuned, it achieved 82% accuracy and 91% ROC AUC on the test set. This means the model effectively distinguished between real and fake reviews.
* **Skills:** `NLP (Text Preprocessing, Tokenization, Sentiment Analysis, Feature Extraction)`, `Machine Learning (Ensemble Modeling, Hyperparameter Tuning, Model Evaluation)`, `Python`, `EDA`
